## Work / Project Examples
* [Anonymous Voting Booth Demo](https://anonvotingbooth.github.io/anonymousVotingBooth/)
![Anonymous Voting Booth App](https://i.imgur.com/lfeXdzp.jpg)
The Anonymous Voting Booth App was developed with three other developers using React and Firebase to allow users to create and vote for user created polls anonymously. My role for this project was to build the login authentication feature that allowed users to store their user created voting polls on Firebase and have that data be retrieved from the database to display on the dashboard. I created two ways to login authentication and one way was where users could sign in with a google account to see their voting polls that they have created based on their user id and the total poll results for their polls. The other way was where users could sign in as a guest account if they don't have a google account, but will not be able to see their created polls after they log out because a new user id will be generated for every new guest account that signs in.

The H-L Index App was a solo project that I designed and built with React to use two stock APIs to display realtime and historical stock data from their endpoints. The user can see what the value of a particular stock was globally, last minute, daily, weekly, and monthly. I built a search feature for this app where the user can search for any type of stock that is available with a custom autocomplete component attached to show suggested stock results. The autocomplete component will filter out stock symbols to closely match the exact search query the user inputs in the search bar. 

## Inspiration
* [3 Tips to Improve Your Progamming Skills by Samantha Ming](https://www.samanthaming.com/blog/3-tips-to-improve-your-programming-skills/)\
I find the content that Samantha Ming posts either on her own personal website and on her twitter account has been very helpful in terms of improving my programming skills. The valuable advice that she talks about which resonates with me to better understand a concept are to build stuff, help others and teach. Usually when I absorb new knowledge from resources that I would read or watch, I would quickly apply that knowledge to my current projects to solidify my learning experience. I recently had the opportunity to volunteer as a mentor at a Workshop hosted by Juno College that allowed me to help others learn the basic concepts about JavaScript. She has also inspired me to start a series on my twitter account where I would post daily content of new methods/techniques I recently learned in JavaScript for example. It is satisfying to share my new found knowledge with other people as it is an excellent way to learn by teaching others and as Samantha quotes "you don't need to be an expert to share". 

* [100 Days 100 Projects by Florin Pop](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/)\
I have noticed that there was a common trend on twitter that has been going on for a good while where people were tagging #100DaysOfCode on their tweets after they built a project or learned about a new concept for 100 days straight. Florin Pop helped influence many people by partaking in this challenge last year while I was enrolled in Juno College's Bootcamp. I found inspiration in the projects that he built like his Voting App which helped me develop ideas for my Anonymous Voting Booth app. While I am still learning new concepts on the side, I have been challenging myself by posting daily on my twitter account to showcase new techniques/skills I have learned for at least 100 days. I am planning to challenge myself to participate in this challenge in the near future to improve my current skills.    

## Focus
With the given time and resources during my internship, I am hoping to build team relationships with the Critical Mass team. I feel that good communication makes for a great team, and creating best practices around how a team is going to communicate is really important. I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will give me exposure to learning more about development best practice and standards, technical designs and troubleshooting through the mentorship. I know Critical Mass values continuous learning which will definitely help me sharpen my skills in React and learn new skills like GraphQL. Before the end of summer, I hope to be deploying and shipping code into production.
